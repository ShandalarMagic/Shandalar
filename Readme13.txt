===========================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE: This ManaLink update is for owners of Duels of
the Planeswalkers and anyone who has installed the ManaLink
multiplayer module. This update will NOT work with the original
Magic: The Gathering game or Spells of the Ancients UNLESS you
have also installed the free ManaLink module.

ManaLink and its updates are available at 
www.gathering.net, 
www.ten.net and www.microprose.com.


How to Update to ManaLink Version 1.3
=====================================
1. Download the file appropriate to your language version of
   Magic: The Gathering (MTG_13US.EXE for English).

2. Double-click on the file and follow the directions in the
   pop-up dialog box. The updater will automatically update 
   the Magic files.

3. To verify that you have successfully updated to ManaLink
   version 1.3, start Magic: The Gathering. Then double-click
   the ManaLink icon and look for "1.3" at the bottom of the 
   window.


General Changes in ManaLink Version 1.3
=======================================
* The "AddCard" assertion errors in Shandalar have been fixed.

* The Info window in ManaLink now has a background graphic and
  a Close button.

* Saved games with a Vesuvan Doppelganger play now load correctly.


General Card Changes in ManaLink Version 1.3
============================================
* Cards that modify the hand size (such as Land Tax) now work
  correctly when used in conjunction with Balance.

* If you are forced to tap dual lands (by a Power Sink, for example),
  you can no longer cancel this action and avoid payment.


Specific Card Changes in ManaLink Version 1.3
=============================================
* Alchor's Tomb now has the correct card text.

* Conversion now works correctly with dual lands (such as the Bayou 
  and Taiga) in play.

* If more than one Fellwar Stone is in play, cards that are playable 
  now light up for casting or activation.

* Gauntlet of Might's known problems are fixed.

* Ifh-Biff Efreet's legacy card now correctly switches sides when the
  creature changes controller.

* Jade Statue lights up properly when it can be activated. In
  addition, it no longer remains tapped if a Meekstone is in play.

* Kudzu is no longer allowed to target the land that it is currently
  enchanting.

* Library of Leng's effect now resolves properly when the card
  leaves play.

* Lich no longer causes you to lose the game if it is counterspelled.

* Mishra's Factory will not turn into an Assembly Worker if it
  is tapped for mana.

* The Necropolis of Azar correctly calculates the number of counters 
  it has on it.

* Nevinyrral's Disk now works correctly when an untapped Guardian 
  Beast is in play.

* Personal Incarnation does not give its effect before resolving 
  (i.e., while still in the spell chain).

* Power Sink no longer forces you to tap lands that do not produce mana
  (such as the Oasis).

* Resurrection now works correctly when it is counterspelled.

* The Sengir Vampire no longer gets a counter when it deals lethal 
  damage to a Mishra's Factory (turned into an Assembly Worker) that 
  has been enchanged with a Consecrate Land.

* Spell Blast now properly calculates the addition costs imposed by
  Gloom.

* Su-Chi no longer gives mana when it is removed from play (vs. going
  to the graveyard).


Additional Cards for Duels of the Planeswalkers
===============================================
As a bonus for owners of Duels of the Planeswalkers, we added the
following 16 cards for your use:
  Amnesia
  Barl's Cage
  Blood Moon
  Book of Rass
  Coal Golem
  Elder Spawn
  Fire Sprites
  Force Spike
  Goblins of the Flarg
  Hyperion Blacksmith
  Martyr's Cry
  Moat
  Rabid Wombat
  Tracker
  Wall of Wonder
  Wormwood Treefolk

(Please note that these 16 new cards are only available if you
have Duels of the Planeswalkers installed. If you have only the 
original Magic: The Gathering game or Spells of the Ancients, you 
will not see these new cards in the Deck Builder. However, you 
will be able to duel someone who has these new cards without any 
problems.)


Changes in Previous ManaLink Updates
====================================
* The Deck Builder displays your deck name and deck type 
  (Unrestricted, Wild, Restricted, Tournament or Highlander)
  in the title bar when you click the Stats button.

* The lag in the Duel has been reduced to allow about six to
  eight times as much data to flow in the same amount of time. 
  This speed increase will vary from machine to machine, but 
  almost everyone should note an improvement in dueling speed.
 
* All of the logic that is responsible for posting the duel
  results to the GatheringNet servers for ranking information
  has been corrected.

* A problem was fixed in which ManaLink would try to establish
  multiple connections to your opponent when registering via
  GatheringNet.

* ManaLink is now better able to handle simultaneous invitations
  (where you are inviting someone who is inviting you at the 
  same time).

* On LAN, modem and serial connections, your name will dynamically
  update in the chat user list if you change your player name
  (via the Player sphere). Unfortunately, it is not possible to
  change your screen name on TEN dynamically.

* The user list in ManaLink will no longer "resort" after you click
  on a column. The user list will remain sorted per your preference
  until another column is selected. Dynamic updates to the list after
  a full retrieval are inserted and reordered according to your
  sort preference.

* If you are sending a message to someone in a duel with the F6 or
  Insert key, your cursor will remain in the message bar.

* If you have Plus! or font smoothing turned on, the text in the
  messages will now anti-alias to their background.

* The message bar at the top of the screen is now 20 pixels shorter
  so as to obscure less playing area.

* The Filter panel no longer closes by clicking on its background.
  Click on the Filter button again in the ManaLink window to close
  the Filter panel.

* If you click the Info button to get info about another player, their
  correct badge will display.

* You can not assign Friend or Mute badges to official online 
  representatives such as MicroProse employees, TEN guides, etc.

* ManaLink's Chat window can now handle more than 500 lines of text. If
  you are saving the contents of the Chat window, however, please be
  aware that the "oldest" lines after 4K of text are expired and are 
  removed from the window.

* Setting your status (Available, Don't Disturb or Need Help) now works
  correctly on GatheringNet. ManaLink now waits for the server to reply 
  with your real status and then updates it after receving this data. 

* You can now send invitations to duel with greater success.

* The messages no longer add an automatic period to the end of your
  sentence if it already has punctuation.

* If minimized, the Chat window's title bar will flash if you receive
  new text.

* The problem with receiving messages from players who did not send you
  a message has been fixed.

* The problem with receiving invitations from players who did not
  invite you has been fixed.
