[fonts]
;Fonts settings.  These are used both by drawcardlib and magic.exe proper.
;None of these can currently be overridden in individual frame files.
;
;Each of these fonts has either four or five settings.  The examples below use
;"Fontvar" as the font variable.
;
;fontFontvar: The name of the font.  Defaults to "MS Sans Serif".
;
;sizeFontvar: The height of the font.  Defaults to 20.
;
;widthFontvar: The width of the font.  If set to 0, then let Windows pick a
;width of the appropriate aspect ratio in fonts that don't honor
;decrementFontvar (see below), or a "sensible" default in those that do (6 for
;BigCardTitle, 5 for BigCardSubtitle and BigCardVanguard, 8 for
;SmallCardTitle).  Those defaults are also used if the given width is below 3.
;Defaults to 0.
;
;decrementFontvar: Used only for BigCardTitle, BigCardSubtitle, and
;SmallCardTitle.  The amount to decrease the font's width in each successively-
;smaller font if the text would be too wide to fit in the space allotted on a
;card.  (Up to three attempts are made for BigCardVanguard; up to ten for
;BigCardTitle, BigCardSubtitle, and SmallCardTitle.)  The units here are 1/4
;the size of those in widthFontvar, so e.g. if widthFontvar is 5 and
;decrementFontvar is 1, the ten sizes tried will be at the equivalent widths of
;5, 4.75, 4.5, 4.25, 4, 3.75, 3.5, 3.25, 3, and 2.75.  Setting this too low
;will make some text not fit into its bounding box even at the narrowest width;
;setting it too high will make it use too narrow a font if the next-wider one
;would just barely overflow.  Defaults to 1.
;
;boldFontvar: if nonzero, then draw the font in boldface.

[Watermarks]
;Watermark metaconfiguration.  (The way watermarks are actually displayed on
;cards is controlled by the [FullCard]Watermark* settings above.)  Can't be
;overridden for individual framesets.
;
;Watermark images should be in CardArt\watermarks.pic and consist of
;equally-tall rows of five equally-wide images each.  The name of each
;watermark, and its placement within watermarks.pic, are specified in this
;section.
;
;Which cards get which watermarks is determined by .\watermarks.csv.  Each line
;should consist of a card id number (from manalink.csv), a semicolon, and a
;watermark name; optionally followed by a semicolon and comment.  If a negative
;number is seen for the id, no further lines are read - useful for documenting
;e.g. split cards with different watermarks on each half that can't be fully
;displayed right now.  (Of course, those could have been done by picking one
;half to display and documenting the other half in the comment, but I chose to
;leave them entirely unwatermarked for now.)
;
;A card can only have one watermark specified for it.  If there are multiple
;lines for a single card, the earlier ones are overwritten by the last.
;
;There are always eight special entries defined for watermarks.csv:
;"Timeshift", "Nyx", "XDay", "XNight", "XSpark", "XIgnite", "XMoon", and
;"XEmrakul".
;
;"Timeshift" means that a given card should be drawn with the Timeshift frame
;if it's being displayed with a Planar Chaos expansion symbol, or the
;Futureshift frame if it's being displayed with a Future Sight expansion
;symbol.
;
;"Nyx" means that it should be drawn with a Nyx overlay (from the Theros block)
;when the card is displayed in the deckbuilder, library, graveyard, etc. -
;everything but in-hand and in-play, which can be deduced from the card's
;types.
;
;The six special entries beginning with "X" indicate double-faced cards.
;"XDay", "XSpark", and "XMoon" mark a card as the front of a dfc; if it would
;normally be drawn with the Modern, Planeswalker, Magic2015, Magic2015holo, or
;Magic2015planeswalker frameset, it's instead drawn with ModernDFCfront,
;Magic2015holoDFCfront, etc.
;"XNight", "XIgnite", and "XEmrakul", similarly, mark a card as the back of a
;dfc, changing the frame to ModernDFCback etc.
;
;Unlike real watermarks, a card can have "Timeshift", "Nyx", and up to one "X"
;entry specified in addition to a normal watermark; to do so, have multiple
;lines for the same card in watermarks.csv, one with Timeshift in the second
;column, one with Nyx, one with a DFC symbol name, and one with a watermark, as
;appropriate.
;

;Opacity multiplier for saturation watermarks, expressed as a percentage.  The
;standard watermarks.pic has saturation watermarks drawn at 10% opacity, so
;1000 will show them fully opaque.  100 uses the opacity in the file unchanged.
;Defaults SaturationOpacity=500.
SaturationOpacity=500
;Darkening multiplier for saturation watermarks, expressed as a percentage.
;100 leaves the value unchanged.
;Defaults SaturationDarken=75.
SaturationDarken=75
;Individual watermark definitions.
;
;Each defined watermark needs a name (to be looked for in the second column of
;watermarks.csv), a row number in watermarks.csv ranging from 1 to NumRows
;(from top to bottom), and a column number in watermarks.csv ranging from 1 to
;NumColumns (from left to right).  Their keys are Name#, Row#, and Col#
;respectively, where # is an integer from 1 to 255.  If any of the three is
;left unset, then the whole watermark is ignored.
;
;Names must be a single word consisting only of letters and perhaps numbers,
;and must start with a letter.  They're not case sensitive.
;
;Watermarks can be drawn either as-is, or by darkening and saturating the
;existing color (using only the watermark image's alpha value).  For the
;former, set Saturation to 0.  For the latter (the default), set it to 1.
;
;Each watermark can also have a list of expansions that it may appear in.  If
;Expansions# is unspecified for a given watermark, it's always drawn for each
;card set to it.  If it's a whitespace-separated list of expansion numbers (as
;defined in src/Expansions.h), then it's only drawn if that expansion symbol
;is.  If it's the name of a previously-defined watermark, it uses that
;watermark's Expansions value.  The point is so that, for example, Disperse can
;be drawn with the Mirran watermark on its Scars of Mirrodins printing, but not
;on its original Morningtide printing or later Magic 2014 reprint.
;([FullCard]WatermarkOutsideSet above can override.)
;

[Frames]
;Overall settings for frame artwork, both for smallcards and fullcards.  The
;variables here may be overridden for specific frame types' files.
;
;None of the settings here are used directly; instead they become the defaults
;for the more specific settings in the individual frame types' files.
;
;
;Percent of a hybrid frame's width that should be a blend of its two source
;frames.  (This includes two-color lands, like Rootbound Crag, two-color
;artifacts, like Mage Slayer, and two-color gold cards, like Apocalypse Hydra,
;in addition to true hybrid cards like Gruul Guildmage.)
;
;For example, when set to 20, a white-blue hybrid card will be 40% white, 40%
;blue, and 20% a blend.  Two-color frames are disabled if this is below 0, and
;the gold frame normally used for three or more colors will be displayed
;instead.  Values above 100 are valid, though, and result in an image where
;even the far left and right are still a blend.
;
;Defaults PercentMixedOnHybrid=30.
PercentMixedOnHybrid = 30
;If non-zero, two-color lands from expansions earlier than Classic Sixth
;Edition are drawn with the gold land frame instead of a hybrid, just as if
;PercentMixedOnHybrid were set below 0.
;Only meaningful for classic frames; may be set here or in Classic.dat.
;Defaults NoEarlyHybridLand=0
NoEarlyHybridLand = 0
;If set to 1, two-color cards (other than lands and artifacts) whose colors
;have been changed are drawn with the hybrid frame instead of the gold one.
;(This is fairly uncommon, since most color change effects replace colors
;instead of adding to them.)
;
;If set to 2, all two-color cards (other than lands and artifacts) are drawn
;with the hybrid frame instead of the gold one.
;
;Defaults TwoColorAsHybrid=0.
TwoColorAsHybrid = 0
;If non-zero, then two-color, non-hybrid, spells and artifacts are drawn the
;same as 3/4/5-color ones - that is, with CardBk_Gold+CardOv_Gold, or
;CardBk_Artifact+CardOv_GoldArtifact, not (for example) CardBk_Gold + a hybrid
;of CardBk_R/CardBk_G.  An active TwoColorAsHybrid takes precedence over this.
;Defaults TwoColorAsGold=0.
TwoColorAsGold = 0
;If set to -1 or below, CardBk_Colorless + CardOv_Colorless are used for
;colorless non-land, non-artifact cards, and are handled identically to other
;frames.
;
;Otherwise, for colorless non-land, non-artifact cards, ignore ArtworkFirst;
;the art is first stretched over the entire frame, and only CardOv_Colorless is
;drawn over it.  Additional options are set by adding together the numbers
;below:
;
;+1: The art is also drawn in its normal place on fullcards, which alleviates
;the distortion a bit.  (The smallcard art is always over the whole card area
;for non-negative values.)
;
;+2: No frame at all is drawn on smallcards.
;
;+4: After drawing the smallcard art stretched to the whole card area, then the
;CardOv_Colorless frame overlay on top of it, draw the smallcard art again,
;clipped to its normal bounding box (but still stretched to the full area).
;You'll want this if your CardOv_Colorless would normally draw over the normal
;art area.
;
;Defaults TranslucentColorless=-1.
TranslucentColorless = -1
;If TranslucentColorless is non-negative, draw CardOv_Colorless with this alpha
;value.
;Defaults ColorlessAlpha=255.
ColorlessAlpha = 255
;If set to -1 or below, colorless face-down creatures are drawn like any other
;colorless card (that is, according to TranslucentColorless).  Otherwise, this
;is used as a replacement for TranslucentColorless, and their FullCards use the
;CardBack artwork.
;Defaults FaceDownCreature=-1.
FaceDownCreature = 2
;If set to 1, artifact lands are drawn with CardBk_Artifact + the
;appropriately-colored CardOv_*Land overlays, so that they're visually
;distinctive from non-artifact lands.
;
;If set to 2, the land overlay is drawn over an artifact-land hybrid frame.
;
;If set to 3, they're drawn as a hybrid colored artifact/colored land.  (The
;difference between this and 2 is that the left half of the textbox, borders,
;and text/type lines are drawn in the lighter shade used by spells and colored
;artifacts.)
;
;Defaults ArtifactLand=0.
ArtifactLand = 0
;If set to 1, then all non-effect cards are forced to use the colorless
;non-land non-artifact frames, and so only CardBk_Special, CardOv_ColorlessNyx,
;and one or both of CardBk_Colorless and CardOv_Colorless (depending on
;TranslucentColorless) are used.
;
;If set to 2, then effect cards use the colorless non-land non-artifact frames
;too (and so only CardOv_ColorlessNyx, CardBk_Colorless, and CardOv_Colorless
;are used).
;
;Defaults ForceColorless=0.
ForceColorless = 0
;The directory, relative to CardArt\, in which frame images are searched for.
;Individual images can further alter this, e.g. to search for most images in
;CardArt\dir1 but for CardBk_Artifact in CardArt\dir2, you'd use
;FrameBaseDir=dir1 and CardBk_Artifact=..\dir2\CardBk_Artifact.pic.
;
;FrameBaseDir and settings for individual artwork files are overridden
;separately in the frame-specific sections below.  In the common case where
;FrameBaseDir is set in a frame-specific section but a specific image's setting
;is not, it will use the directory set in e.g. Modern.dat's
;[Frames]FrameBaseDir but the filename set here in [Frames].
;
;To make an unoverriden file in a specific directory always be the one read
;despite an overridden FrameBaseDir, incorporate that directory into the
;filename in the [Frames] section, so that CardArt\FrameBaseDir\Filename always
;ends up referring to it.  For example, if every FrameBaseDir used is a
;subdirectory of .\CardArt (such as "modern", hence .\CardArt\modern\, or
;"classic", hence .\CardArt\classic\), to make all frame types use
;.\CardArt\modern\CardOv_WNyx.png for white multitype enchantments, set
;CardOv_WNyx to "..\modern\CardOv_WNyx.png".
;
;Defaults FrameBaseDir=.
FrameBaseDir=modern
;If set to nonempty in a frame-specific configuration file, then any other
;images for that frame type that aren't explicitly overridden in that file use
;this image instead.  (Normally, they use the corresponding image in Duel.dat.)
