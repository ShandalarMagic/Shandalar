  The other players must type your IP adress to connect.

That's all. Newest updates should be always available on this page:

History
-------

Changes in version 1.3.2 - Second release
 (and probably the last one - I failed to get MtG source code from
  MPS for more enhancements so I lost interest in the whole project).

- All: hopefully finally fixed to work on Windows ME. Previous patch
  worked only in rare cases (my machine for example ;)

- All: experimental patch for Windows 2000. I didn't test it much,
  so please report any problems. Anyone willing to test it on Win XP?

- Shandalar: slowed down even more for the 1GHz+ machines.

- Shandalar: fixed crash when trying to sell Mana Crypt.

- Shandalar: fixed displaying wrong amulet color when offered
  by your opponent.

Changes in version 1.3.1 - First release

- Manalink: replaced serial connection with Internet TCP/IP connection.

- Magic: randomizing routines replaced. But it will NOT give you more mana
  in manalink. Not enough mana in manalink is only a myth. Actually, the game
  cheats and gives you MORE mana sources when playing against the computer :)
  and that's why you might get an impression that you are receiving not enough
  mana in manalink.

- All: fixed to run in Windows Millennium Edition. But if you are thinking
  about moving from Win 98 to ME, think again. ME is piece of s**t.

- All: enabled all the cards regardless of which expansions you have installed.

- All: CD check removed.

- Shandalar: slowed down to work on very fast computers at reasonable speed.

- Magic: debug menu removed.

- Deckbuilder: fixed "stats" of several cards (mana sources):
  - Badlands (black and red)
  - Mana Batteries (their appropriate colors)
  - Celestial Prism (all colors)
  - Sunglasses of Urza (no longer mana source)
  - Channel (colorless)
  - Drain Power (colorless)
  - Energy Tap (colorless)
  - Fastbond (colorless)
  - Reset (colorless)
  - Untamed Wilds (colorless)
  - Land Tax (no longer mana source)
  - Mana Flare (colorless)
  - Apprentice Wizard (colorless)
  - Coal Golem (red)
  - Elves of Deep Shadow (black)
  - Fire Sprites (red)
  - Ley Druid (colorless)
  - Gauntlet of Might (red)
