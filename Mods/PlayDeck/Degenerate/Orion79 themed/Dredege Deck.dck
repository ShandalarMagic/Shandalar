;The Dredge Deck focuses on creatures with the Dredege ability, together with Yawgmoth's Will, Lord of Extinction and Tarmogoyf to maximize the benefits. Also, to prevent the extinction of resources from the deck, there wuould be Gaea's Blessing to re-shuffle the whole graveyard into owner's library, but a bug with it causes the player to loose due to lack of cards.
