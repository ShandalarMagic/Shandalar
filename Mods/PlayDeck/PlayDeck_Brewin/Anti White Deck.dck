;This deck is created to be the nightmare of White decks. Many red or black white-warded creatures are very hard to kill for White, while Rukh Egg turns a Wrath of God into an advantage,Tranquillity moops up all enchantments and Diabolic Edict and Ghostfire will kill even creatures with protection from red and/or black.
