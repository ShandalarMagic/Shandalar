;4th Edition
;This deck is based on the Guardian Beast and can be both funny to use and effective: in fact, it uses Urza's Land and Mishra's Workshop to quickly play expensive black spells and big non-creature artifacts, which will be made indestructibile by Guardian beast, including the artifact land "Vault of Whispers".
