;4th Edition
;Zendikar is a very rich stand-alone set, with plenty of powerful cards for each color and the new Landfall ability. The second choice is for U+B, since blue grants the usual great ability for drawing cards and some very good creature with flying, while black has the new wave of vampire cards.
