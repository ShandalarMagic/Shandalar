Gotcha! Man... I bet you didn't see that one coming.
Gotcha! You gotta admit... that was rather spectacular!
Gotcha! ...don't be such a sore loser. You wanna play again?
Gotcha! ...and there you have it, another superior game played by me.
Gotcha! ...what?! You didn't expect to win against a Computer, did you?
You're a loser.  I can't believe you lost to a computer... HA!
You're a loser.  Don't feel too bad, we were all beginners once.
You're a loser.  That makes me the winner! Now I get to gloat... nyaa-nyaa.
You're a loser.  Seriously?! Was that the best you could do? Sad... very sad.
You're a loser.  Well, that felt good... wanna go again?
I've won this hand... and no, I didn't cheat. Not even a little.
I've won this hand. Didn't I win the last hand... and the one before that...
I've won this hand... because I'm a much better player than you.
I've won this hand, and I'll probably win the next... 'cause you're so predictable.
I've won this hand. Winning isn't everything... but losing really sucks. Ha!
I win!  Oh yea, that's right... in your face!
I win!  So I think that would make you... the Loser.
I win!  As a human you must know that you are vastly inferior to my kind.
I win!  Again and again I win... why don't you ever get any better?
I win!  You lost to a computer... am I the only one who thinks that's funny?
You've lost the game.  I don't think that really surprises anyone.
You've lost the game.  I'm a computer... it was an inevitable outcome.
You've lost the game.  Come on, admit it. I played a really good game.
You've lost the game.  You wanna celebrate by playing another hand?
You've lost the game.  My grandmother plays a better game of Magic.
You lost.  And don't try that mana locked excuse on me bub.
You lost.  No...the computer doesn't cheat. Not even a little bit.
You lost.  Hey, you could always try badminton.
You lost.  So what do you do for an encore, line dance?
You lost.  I've played better games against your toaster.

I didn't win?! We must play again, so I can kill you properly.
OK, that was really lame... dying at the same time like that.
You are a fierce competitor... let us duel again.
A tie? ...really, what are the chances. Tie-breaker time!
We tied? OK, get ready for a tie-breaker.
It's a tie?! That's no way to end a duel. Another hand will settle this...
Really, a tie? That's very unsatisfying... and I demand satisfaction.
The duel was a tie.  You've found your equal!
The duel was a tie.  At least you didn't LOSE to a computer.
The duel was a tie.  At least I didn't LOSE to a human.

What the..? I can't believe that I just lost to a human.
What the..? But you ALWAYS win... it's not fair, I'm tellin' ya.
What the..? Man, there's nothing more humiliating than losing to a human.
What the..? Another landslide, that was a total massacre!
What the..? Another horrible loss... to a human... when will I ever learn?
I lost?!  I'm a computer... how could this possibly happen?
I lost?!  ...does not compute ...does not compute ...*sizzle*
I lost?!  Ok, so how'd you pull that off?  ...no, seriously. How'd you do it?
I lost?  But I was so close! That really burns my diodes.
I lost?  To a human?! Don't tell the other computers, this is really humiliating.
I lost this hand. That's surprising... you're usually such a poor player.
I lost this hand... and I'm simply not very happy with that. *grr*
I lost this hand. That's weird... I usually kick your butt, don't I?
I lost this hand. That's impossible... you must've cheated. Cheater!
I lost this hand, but it's a new deck, and I'm still workin' out the kinks.
You're a winner.  OK, so you won a hand... big whoop.
You're a winner.  Well, there's a shock. I didn't think you had it in you.
You're a winner.  Yea, yea... Sure, sure... go ahead and gloat.
You're a winner.  You really steam-rolled me that time.
You're a winner.  That makes me the loser. Sad... very sad.
You've won the game.  That'll teach me to stop paying attention to the game.
You've won the game.  Again?! When will I ever catch a break?
I've lost the game.  That's not supposed to happen... ever.
I've lost the game.  Revenge, I seek revenge... one more hand.
I've lost the game.  Yikes! That was a massacre. I didn't stand a chance.
You won!  Don't gloat, computers are people too.
You won.  Give me a bigger swap file and I'll wipe that smirk off your face.
You won.  Yeah, but can you beat me using only 1s and 0s?
You won.  Of course, I didn't draw enough land...
You won.  Wanna play "best 0101 out of 0111"?
