;With a splash of Green for Yavimaya Barbarians, this quite effective. Balduvian Horde is powerful but has a severe penalty and placing 4 of them in the deck was simply not possibile. Still, all barbarians are nice creatures (some more, some less) and they can do a true barbaric horde with Keldon Warlord and Coat of Arms.
