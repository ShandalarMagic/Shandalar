;4th Edition
;Another version of the Keldon Warlord deck, that instead is a bit more balanced, with spells, but also uses more token-generator creatures in weird combos, that allow to recover most of the creatures destroyed by opponent, without really loosing any card and producing endless Rukh creatures.
