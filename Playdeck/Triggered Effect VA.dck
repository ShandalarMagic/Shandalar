;4th Edition
;A curious deck that uses capsize in combination with creatures that bring some advantage when each of them "comes into play". They become a sort of expensive buyback (and some of them can't be used because are more expensive than permanents with the same effect), but are very helpful too. This version draws a lot of lands very quickly.
