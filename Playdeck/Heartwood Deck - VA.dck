;4th Edition
;The Heartwood Deck maximizes the Avatar ability using a deck that almost only contains creatures. Among those creatures, it is full of "starters" that are basically 2/1 for G, playable in 1st hand, while other creatures, as Mold Shambler or Indrik Stomphowler, replace Naturalize and are cheaper to play.
