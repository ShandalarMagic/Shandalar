;4th Edition
;9th Edition still carries on a new rebalancement among colors: white unable to destroy artifacts and blue with very expensive or slow counterspells. For those reasons, this deck is a mix of white and black colors, able to kill creatures (Master decoy + Royal Assassin) and to destroy enchantments at least.
