;This deck is really funny, cos' the Wombat will grow stronger than any leviathan! It works in team with Yavimaya Enchantress, which has a similar ability. Enchantress's Presence is much stronger than Verduran Enchantress. The Honden of Life's Web and Centaur Glade will provide tokens as cannon meat and alternative targets for own enchant-creature spells, in case of slow game.
