;4th Edition
;The Intruder Alarm deck is based on the combo with Intruder Alarm and Kiki-Jiki: use the legendary goblin to clone one of own creatures, untapping all of own creatures at one, including Kiki-Jiki for an eternal loop. This version also uses Green for a lot of cool cards and is probably the strongest of the 3 decks.
