;4th Edition
;The Okk Constriction Deck uses the "lame" Okk card together with other good creatures with power of 5 or greater. Even if the Okk can't do anything alone, very soon it may attack with the other creatures, becoming a good support to the army. It is also perfect as bounge target for Shivan Wurm.
