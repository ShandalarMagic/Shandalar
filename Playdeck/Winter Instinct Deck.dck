;The "Winter series" include decks based on very cheap creatures and Winter Orb to slow down opponent only. The green version, the first among Winter decks, can use mana-producing creatures to almost ignore Winter Orb effects. Also, it does rely on a great arsenal of cheap creatures that will deal a lot of damage for very few mana.
