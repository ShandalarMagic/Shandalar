;This funny but nice deck uses black-warded green creatures, which are immune to Pestilence, with Fungusaur. It is somehow also immune, because it will always get a +1/+1 counter each time that it is damaged by Pestilence and it is possible to immensely pump it, cleaning the field from opponent's creatures at once, too.
