;4th Edition
;The Zur's Deck is based right on the omonimous Zur the Enchanter card. It is made almost only of enchantments that cost 3 or less to play, so that Zur will be virtually able to draw & put into play the whole deck. Use Academy Rector as cannon meat and the tutors to search for Zur and/or Diplomatic Immunity to protect him. Maze of Ith and Karakas have the same purpose.
