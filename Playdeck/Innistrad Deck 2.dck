;Innistrad set is the first set to enhance the "human tribe", also introducing the new Werewolves and the ability to "transform" cards (an evolution of the face-up ability). This deck is an aggressive black-red with plenty of resources. Very similar to an undead army, it also uses Curses to kill the player.
