;The idea is that most spells and activated abilities are illegal
;during those steps, so a player never gets a chance to respond to the
;triggers; and those steps are usually the first thing that happens after an
;ability or spell resolves, so players rarely have a chance to respond to
;triggers at all.
;

[Appearance]
;See also DuelArt\Duel.dat, which determines the appearance of cards.
;
;
;If set to 1, runs in a 1024x768 window without changing screen resolution.
;The deckbuilder runs in a separate window at full screen size.  Duel's
;subwindows don't confine themselves to this main window, and keyboard commands
;in duel won't work unless one of the subwindows is active.  Adventure Mode
;doesn't repaint properly if another window temporarily covers its window.  And
;the Facemaker still forces screen resolution to 1024x768.  Still, all in all,
;it's less irritating than changing screen resolution constantly.
;
;Setting this to 2 does the same with regards to Adventure Mode, the
;Deckbuilder, and the Facemaker; but Duel runs in a separate window at full
;screen resolution.  This generally works better, though the artwork for
;everything but cards will be at the wrong aspect ratio.
;
;Defaults Window = 0.

;If set to a value greater than 0, then sets the width and height in pixels of
;smallcards during Duel.
;
;If set to a value less than 0, then sets the width and height in pixels of
;smallcards equal to the width of the Duel window divided by that (0 - value).
;
;If set to 0, then the same as -8: the width of the Duel window divided by 8.
;This is the default in the original game; at 1024x768, it's 128 pixels.
;
;Defaults SmallCardSize = 0.
SmallCardSize = 0

;If set to a value greater than 0, then sets the width and height in pixels of
;ability icons during Duel.  The Windows GDI interface used to display
;graphics, when asked to resize alpha-blended images, can do so either very
;slowly or at very low quality; ability icons are drawn the second way, so
;they'll look pretty poor unless they're drawn at the exact same size as in
;their source image (see AbilityIconPic below).
;
;If set to 0 or less, then sets width and height of ability icons to 16% of
;smallcards' width (rounded down) as assigned by SmallCardSize above.  This is
;20x20 pixels at 1024x768 resolution.

;The maximum number of ability icons that can be simultaneously shown on a
;single smallcard.  In practice, it's very rare for more than six icons to be
;shown, and almost never twelve or more; if you've set AbilityIconSize above to
;be especially large relative to SmallCardSize, those might be enough to
;overlap the card name, which looks ugly.
;
;If set to less than 0, then not only is no limit imposed, but every icon is
;displayed on every card, so you can figure out the proper value to set.
;
;At a SmallCardSize of 128 and an AbilityIconSize of 20, 26 icons can fit onto

[CardsOwned]
;If set to a positive number, then you start each game with that many
;additional basic lands of each type.  If set to a negative number, you start

[Cards]
;If set to anything but 0, then all creatures cards implemented in Manalink can
;be found in Shandalar.  They'll be almost completely vanilla.  They'll
;correctly have basic keyword abilities that existed in the original game -
;basic landwalks, banding, trample, first strike, reach, protection from colors
;or artifacts - as well as double strike, infect, and shroud.  Deathtouch,
;fear, haste, hexproof, horsemanship, indestructible, intimidate, lifelink,
;shadow, vigilance, and wither are detected by a simple text match on their
;rules text (which might have false positives or negatives).  They will *not*
;have most of their text.  So Phyrexian Soulgorger, for example, is a vanilla 8/8
;creature for 3 with no drawbacks.
;
;If a savegame containing cards found only because this setting was on is
;loaded on a run where it's off, then the game will crash.  Definitely during

[Lair]
;Whether to award bonus cards at named lairs with (almost) the original
;chances or with a "fixed" one.
;
;By default (see UnnamedChance below), there's a 2/3 chance of getting an
;unnamed lair, which will give you either a basic land or a random card of any
;rarity, and nothing else.  This setting doesn't affect that.
;
;Using the original algorithm, there's usually a 1/4 chance of getting a random
;rare or mythic rare card.  If you answer a quiz correctly at a Loremaster's
;Tower or Pyramids of Aska-Tet, you always get one.  (There's still the 1/4
;chance of getting a card if you answer incorrectly.)  If you lose gold or
;amulets at a Thieves Hideout or Lost City of El'Akram, you also always get
;one; or if you gain gold or amulets at a Thieves Hideout or Lost City of
;El'Akram, you never get one.
;
;This still differs slightly from the vanilla Shandalar algorithm.  In that,
;answering a question at a Loremaster's Tower correctly resulted in either a
;colorless (1/3 chance) or correctly-colored card, though always rare and never
;mythic rare; answering incorrectly, or at any other type of lair (including
;the otherwise-identical Pyramids of Aska-Tet), bonus cards could be any color.
;
;Using the fixed algorithm, whether to get a bonus card is more directly tied
;to the type of lair:
;* Abandoned Shrine, Dragon's Lair, Hall of the Sultan, or Spectral Arena
;  (duel): nothing
;* Diamond Mine or Nomad's Bazaar (buy cards for amulets or gold): any rarity
;  if you don't buy any cards; nothing if you do
;* Gemcutter's Guild (buy amulets): any rarity if you don't buy any amulets;
;  nothing if you do
;* Guardian's Ghost (see enemy deck for amulet): rare or mythic if you look at
;  a deck; nothing if you don't.  If you had no amulets at all, then 1/4 chance
;  of finding a card of any rarity, 3/4 chance of nothing.
;* Loremaster's Tower or Pyramids of Aska-Tet (quiz): rare/mythic if answered
;  correctly; nothing if incorrectly
;* Lost City of El'Akram (find/lose amulets): nothing if you find amulets;
;  rare/mythic if you lose amulets
;* Oasis of Muldoon (trade card for 5 life next duel): rare/mythic if you trade
;  a card; nothing if you don't.
;* Ruined Tower (dungeon hint): card of any rarity.
;* Thieves Hideout (find/lose gold): nothing if you find gold; rare/mythic if
;  you lose gold
;
;Set to 1 to use the original algorithm, 0 to used the fixed one.

;Chance to get an unnamed lair, as compared to an named one.  (Unnamed lairs

;color matching the lair.)
;
;If greater than 0, the chance is (that number minus one) out of (that number).
;If less than 0, the chance is 1 out of (negative that number).
;
;For example, -4 means get an unnamed lair 1 time out of 4, while 3 means 2 out

;The chance out of 100 of a bonus card being colorless; otherwise, it's

;to be the color or colors of mana they produce.  For example, you can only
;find a Marble Diamond or Kabira Crossroads at a white lair and only if the

[Sets]
;This section determines when cards from named Magic expansions appear.
;
;Lines listed in this section should follow the form:
;[setname1]--[setname2]=[disposition]
;including the -- (two of them in a row) and =, but not the [].
;
;setname1 and setname2 indicate a range of sets to set.  They must exactly
;match entries from the @EXPANSIONNAMES block in Menus.txt, and furthermore
;should not include any of the first eight format-defining pseudo-expansions
;like (T1.X) Extended - the first valid one is Promo.  setname2 should appear
;later than in Menus.txt than setname1.
;
;Either or both of setname1 or setname2 may be omitted.  If setname1 isn't
;present, then the rule affects cards in all sets up to and including setname2.
;If setname2 isn't present, then the rule affects cards in all sets from
;setname1 onward.  If neither is present (and so the line looks like
;"--=enable" or "--=nosale" or so on), then the rule matches all cards in all
;sets.
;
;You can also omit the "--[setname2]" to indicate a rules that matches only one
;set, as an alternative to writing out "[setname1]--[setname2]=[disposition]".
;For example, you could disable all cards that were printed in the Legends set
;by writing "Legends=disable" rather than "Legends--Legends=disable".
;
;disposition should always be one of "enable", "nosale", "nochoose", "disable",
;or "ignore" (without the " quotation marks):
;
;* "enable" means that cards in the named range of sets appear normally.
;
;* "nosale" means they won't be generated for sale in towns, and won't appear
;as one of the initially-owned cards at the start of a new game.
;
;* "nochoose" means everything "nosale" does, and the cards also can't be
;chosen in the cardpicker, whether as quest rewards, trading amulets for cards
;in cities, bought for gold in Nomad's Bazaars, or bought for amulets in
;Diamond Mines.
;
;* "disable" almost completely removes the cards from the game.  In addition to
;everything in "nosale" and "nochoose", they won't be found randomly (whether
;in Lairs or after defeating enemies).  They can, however, still appear as
;dungeon treasures, in enemy decks, and as "free" cards in duels, dungeons, or
;castles.
;
;* "ignore" means that these sets can never be matched by other rules except
;for "--=[disposition]".  (Cards from these expansions can still be matched by
;rules for other sets they were printed in.)  Useful for reprint-only sets like
;Masters Edition or Modern Masters.
;
;Setting too many sets to "nosale" or worse will cause the game to freeze when
;it tries to generate an initial list of cards; if, for example, the only
;expansion set to "enable" is Ice Age, you can't start a game as a Red Wizard,
;since it can't find enough different red enchantments to put in your deck.
;It's also possible that it'll run into a similar problem when trying to
;generate a card for sale in a city or village.
;
;The rules defined in this section are evaluated sequentially, and the first
;matching rule for each card is chosen.  This is important, since - because of
;reprints - many cards appear in multiple expansion sets.  So, for example, if
;you wanted to play a game including only sets up to and including Ice Age,
;then these lines:
;--Ice Age=enable
;--=disable
;would work, but these lines would not:
;Chronicles--=disable
;--=enable
;even though Chronicles is the next set listed after Ice Age - the latter pair
;of rules would exclude any cards reprinted in any set from Chronicles onward.
;Abyssal Specter, for example, would be disabled since the rule matching its
;appearances in Fifth Edition, Sixth Edition Classic, Seventh Edition, and so
;on would match before the rule matching its appearance in Ice Age.
;
;However, expansions set to "ignore" take precedence over other rules, even if
;they appear later.
;
;Cards that don't match any rule defined in the section are treated the same as
;"enable".
;
;The disposition of individual cards can also be set in the [Enable], [Nosale],
;[Nochoose], [Disable], and [DungeonTreasure] sections.  Each of those sections
;takes precedence over the set-based rules listed in this section.


[Enable]
;Individual cards listed in this section always appear normally in the game,
;even if they would have been removed from sale, the cardpicker, and/or the
;game because it matches an expansion rule in the [Sets] section.
;
;Cards should be listed one per line.  Either a card's name or its id number
;from card_id.h can be used to identify it.  (The latter is primarily useful
;for cards with accents.)
;
;No cards are specifically listed as Enable by default; however, regardless of
;any other settings, the five basic lands are always enabled.


[Nosale]
;Individual cards listed in this section won't be offered for sale in cities
;and villages, and won't be in the initial pool of cards owned at the start of
;a new game, and otherwise will appear normally in the game; even if the card
;would have been fully enabled or removed from the cardpicker or game because
;it matches an expansion rule in the [Sets] section.
;
;Cards should be listed one per line.  Either a card's name or its id number
;from card_id.h can be used to identify it.  (The latter is primarily useful
;for cards with accents.)  Listing a card in this section will override its
;appearance in the [Enable] section if it's in both.
;
;No cards are specifically listed as Nosale by default.


[Nochoose]
;Individual cards listed in this section can't be chosen in the cardpicker
;(whether as a quest reward or trading for gold or amulets), and - like Nosale
;cards - won't be offered for sale in cities and villages and won't be in the
;initial pool of cards owned at the start of a new game.  This overrides any
;rules the card would have matched due to its expansion appearing in the [Sets]
;section.
;
;Cards should be listed one per line.  Either a card's name or its id number
;from card_id.h can be used to identify it.  (The latter is primarily useful
;for cards with accents.)  Listing a card in this section will override its
;appearance in the [Enable] or [Nosale] sections if it's also in any of those.
;
;No cards are listed as Nochoose by default, but the standard configuration
;lists most of the cards on the Vintage restricted list and Legacy banned list.
;(The restricted and banned cards not included here are the ante cards,
;conspiracies, un-set cards, the two dexterity cards (Chaos Orb and Falling
;Star), and Shahrazad.  As an exception to this exception, Contract from Below
;*is* listed as Nochoose, because it's pretty ridiculous.)  Note that some of
;these aren't actually implemented in the game yet.
;
;The 30 worst of them are assigned as Dungeon Treasures below; the rest are,
;paradoxically, even harder to find.

[Disable]
;Individual cards listed in this section are almost entirely removed from the
;game: they won't be sold in towns, found randomly, appear in the player's
;initially-owned cards, etc.  They can, however, still appear as dungeon
;treasures, in enemy decks, and as "free" cards in duels.  This overrides any
;rules the card would have matched due to its expansion appearing in the [Sets]
;section.
;
;Cards should be listed one per line.  Either a card's name or its id number
;from card_id.h can be used to identify it.  (The latter is primarily useful
;for cards with accents.)  Listing a card in this section will override its
;appearance in the [Enable], [Nosale], or [Nochoose] sections if it's also in
;any of those.
;
;No cards are disabled by default, but Duh is listed in the standard config,
;since it's from an un-set.
Duh


[DungeonTreasure]
;Individual cards listed in this section can only be acquired by finding them
;in dungeons.  This overrides any rules the card would have matched due to its
;expansion appearing in the [Sets] section.
;
;Cards should be listed one per line.  Either a card's name or its id number
;from card_id.h can be used to identify it.  (The latter is primarily useful
;for cards with accents.)  Listing a card in this section will override its
;appearance in the [Enable], [Nosale], [Nochoose], or [Disable] sections if
;it's also in any of those.
;
;Only the first 30 cards listed in this section will appear as dungeon
;treasures; any excess will be treated as Disabled.  (I'm uncertain what
;happens if fewer are listed.)
;
;If no cards are listed, then the following 30 cards become dungeon treasures:
;Ancestral Recall, Balance, Black Lotus, Channel, Contract from Below,
;Demonic Tutor, Fastbond, Imperial Seal, Library of Alexandria, Lotus Petal,
;Mana Crypt, Mishra's Workshop, Mox Emerald, Mox Jet, Mox Pearl, Mox Ruby,
;Mox Sapphire, Mystical Tutor, Necropotence, Sol Ring, Strip Mine, Time Vault,
;Time Walk, Timetwister, Tinker, Tolarian Academy, Vampiric Tutor,

[Enemies]
;If set to anything but 0, a creature with Mind Control (copy player's deck)
;also copies the player's initially-drawn hand, as in the original game.  I
;always thought this was a bug, but apparently it's deliberate, hence the
;option to preserve the old behavior.
;
;Defaults MindControlCopiesHand = 0.
MindControlCopiesHand = 0

;The number of victories you must have over a particular enemy before it will
;flee from you.  The count is kept separately for each color of terrain an
;enemy spawns on - for example, your victories against Fungus Masters who
;spawned in Forests won't count against Fungus Masters who spawned on Islands.
;
;If a negative number, then the game difficulty level (0 for Apprentice through
;3 for Wizard) is added to its absolute value.  For example, the default value
;of -3 means that you need 3 victories for an enemy to flee at Apprentice
;level, 4 at Magician, 5 at Sorcerer, and 6 at Wizard.
;
;Defaults VictoriesForFlee = -3.
VictoriesForFlee = -3

;The number of victories you must have over a particular enemy spawned in a
;particular color of terrain before it will offer tribute to you.
;
;If a negative number, then the game difficulty level is added to its absolute
;value.
