;4th Edition
;A mono-artifact deck. It is nice to play (also because Su-Chi is much stronger with manaburn removed) but it suffers for the lack of anti-permanent cards and is very vulnerable against all coloros, especially White and Red, but stronger against Black. Use the D.Scepter as secondary resource to weak your opponent.
