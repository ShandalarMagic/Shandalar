;4th Edition
;The red school of wizardry is among the most powerful ones: magus of the moon may profe to be deadly against pentacolor decks, locking the game; prodigal Pyromancer is the dead of X/1 creatures and Magus of the Arena, aided by "the brute", may be used as self-target to challenge and kill opponent's creatures. Green, here, may only be a support but Magus of the Library's power is outstanding.
