;This deck arises almost obviously from the combo among Ajani Pridemate and Kor Firewalker. Since the second one turns any red spell (also own spells) into a source of life points, the Pridemate will grow stronger and stronger each turn. The most difficult thing is to have creatures surviving the earliest stages of the game.
