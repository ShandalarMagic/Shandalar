;4th Edition
;Timespiral set has been a special set characterized by an unique mix of everal reprintings, new cards that were a rearrangement of older cards, and totally new cards. This deck uses B-R-U because it has the most complete set of resources to draw, compensating the lack of resolutive anti-permanent spells.
